Test V2:
Requirements 	- Visual studio
				- Git 
				- Anything to draw diagrams with (Visio, Drawio, Pen and paper.)

Here is a simple api backend built by chatGPT. 

We have many Users spread out accross the world (Asia, Europe, Oceania).
Each User is an Orchardist who has one or more orchards.
Each orchard has zero or more weather stations.
Each orchard grows one or more variety of crop.

An Orchardist must spray their crop within 48 hours of the last rainfall if there is any precipitation.
The spray type depends on the variety of crop. 
As such they need to know the date and time that rain started and ended on their orchard and what spray they need to use.
Each spray can only be used below a certain wind speed.

COMMIT AND PUSH AFTER EACH TASK IS COMPLETE.

tasks are as follows:


1. Build, run, and read the swagger docs.

2. Add brief comments to the existing code to explain what it does, and why.

3. Explain, using diagrams where appropriate how you would achieve our users requirements.

4. Build some endpoints for a WEATHEREVENT to demonstrate functionality of your prototype.

6. What test cases would you use?

7. What are the limitations of this build?
